# MFCC_features_script

First install the opensmile toolkit from the official cite (https://www.audeering.com/opensmile/).
Change the directory of audio files and output files in opensmile_mfcc.py
The output files are in '.htk' format. Therefore to convert all these .htk format to csv version use the matlab script (htkread_new.m, run_new.m )
